<!--BlackDoc is a two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that's ideal for websites that require a master-detail layout for viewing of content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler, and the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme.

I needed a two-column layout with a scrolling sidebar to publish my [code cheatsheets](http://karloespiritu.com/cheatsheets), and found the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) Jekyll theme to be a good starting theme. To complement the color scheme of my main [website](http://karloespiritu.com), I customised the theme to make it look great in black background and changed the sidebar to display scrolling content. I created this theme because I can't seem to find any good Jekyll theme with a master-detail layout. Hopefully, someone will find this useful as well in their own projects.-->

### Education

<!--Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as a foundation for creating Jekyll themes. Poole-based themes, such as BlackDoc here, include the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting using Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)-->
